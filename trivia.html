    <h2>10 Interesting Facts About Alan Turing</h2>
    <li>Alan would wear a gas mask to avoid the pollens that
    gave him hayfever.</li>
    <li>Alan became an atheist, but still believed that the spirit
    survived the death of the body.</li>
    <li>In 1948 Alan wrote one of the first chess programs for a computer.
      The computer did not have the power to run the program, so he ran
      the algorithims manually.</li>
    <li>Alan's family is titled - he was the uncle of the 12 baronet
      Turing.</li>
    <li>In addition to his work in mathematics and electrical engineering,
      he was also very interested in chemistry and biology and wrote
      papers on those subjects.</li>
    <li>Alan was an avid runner. In 1948 he ran his best marathon time
      in 2 hours, 46 minutes and 3 seconds. This was only eleven minutes
      slower than the Olympic winning time that year.</li>
    <li>His fascination with daisies led to a completely new field of
      mathematical biology called morphogenesis. It is a mathematical
      explanation of how things grow.</li>
    <li>Alan spoke with a stutter.</li>
    <li>Despite the laws at the time, Turing was openly gay.</li>
    <li>While many consider his death by cyanide poisoning to have been
      an act of suicide, possibly prompted by the controversy in his
      personal life, other more knowledgeable sources indicate that he
      was working on an experimental computer component that required
      significant amounts of cyanide, and that his poisoning may
      have been accidental.</li>
