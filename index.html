      Alan Turing was an English computer scientist, mathematician,
      logician, crypanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly
      influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
      providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and
      computation with the Turing machine which can be considered a
      model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered
      to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial
      intelligence.

      During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government code
      and Cypher Schools at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre.
      For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval
      crypanalysis. He deviced a number of techniques for breaking German
      ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method
      and an electromeechanical machine that could find settings for the
      Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted
      coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many
      crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic. It has
      been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by as many
      as two to four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where
      designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer.
      In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, where
      he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in
      mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of
      morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
      Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.

      Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behaviour
      was still a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES
      (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954,
      16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest
      determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the evidence
      is equally consistent with accidental poisoning.

      In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon
      Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government
      for "the appalling way he was treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him
      a posthumous pardon in 2013.

      The Alan Turing building at the University of Manchester houses the
      School of Mathematics, the Photon Science Institute and the Jodrell Bank
      Centre for Astrophysics. The building is located in the Chorlton-on-Medlock
      district of Manchester, on upper Brook Street, and is adjacent to the new
      University Place:
